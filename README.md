# Steps - 

 1st step- understand what data you have and what areyou looking at
 2nd step-load the data
 3rd step- prepare the data with index and standard scaler
 4th step- create a k- list values
 5ht step - develop the inertia values with a loop
 6th step - Create dictionaries 
 7th step plot line  of inertia values computed to obtain the numer of clustesrs
 8th step- predict the clusters and add  them to the data 
 9th step - Retrive the explain variances ratio. 

 Repeat all steps with the PCA components and compare to know which has a better result and why. 

 In this case it is easier o handle the PCAs Components due to the lower clusters, but it losses information. Note* This does not mean that is a bad model.
